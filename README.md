## How to Use

1. Install Writus: `cargo install writus`;
2. Run Writus: `writus`.

Although all the APIs *work*, as described in the [docs](https://github.com/PENGUINLIONG/Writus/wiki/API-Docs), it's worth spending some time [configuring](https://github.com/PENGUINLIONG/Writus/wiki/Configure-Writus) Writus.

## Customize

Writus has no finished views. The views need to be customized with page templates, otherwise you can see nothing via your browser. Please refer to [this wiki page](https://github.com/PENGUINLIONG/Writus/wiki/Templates) for more information. A example front-end project can be found [here](https://github.com/PENGUINLIONG/Writus-Example).
